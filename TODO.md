# TO-DO List

## General:

- [ ] Add more information about license. (I'm hesitating between CC-By and CC-By-Sa. CC-By-Sa might ensure the merge back or disposal of the improvement made by a third party publisher finding/exploiting this repo. CC-By-Sa can wrap around the page in CC-By without any problems)

## 01_cover.sla

Cover of the book. Needs to be appealing and different from the already published ones. 

Right now I'm not really happy with the full image for the cover. 

I would prefer a frame and title a bit graphically richer. Something looking like a vintage[1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bf/8c/ce/bf8cce65393ce10574397412dcb33995.jpg) USComic/Manga.

This publishing needs to feels the 'collector' one.
