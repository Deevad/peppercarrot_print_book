This repository was created to ease collaborative work on the desktop-publishing of the open-source first book of [Pepper&Carrot](http://wwww.peppercarrot.com) comic.

## Description

* At root, only Scribus files and this README.
* ```img``` contains original graphics made for the book. Krita files, or PNG files.
* ```pages``` folder contains the comic page images.

## Install

You'll need :
* the official Pepper&Carrot font pack [https://github.com/Deevad/peppercarrot_fonts](https://github.com/Deevad/peppercarrot_fonts)
* Scribus 1.5.2 or better _(I'm using scribus-1.5.2-linux-x86_64.AppImage)_.
* Krita 3.0 or better _(I'm using last stable appimage)_.


The repository don't contains the comic page themself to keep the repository lightweight.
You can download the English pack here [http://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static6/sources&page=download](http://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static6/sources&page=download) , and extract the content into the ```pages``` folder.
